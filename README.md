### About Dataset
The data provides a trend in energy consumption: i.e. fossil fuels and renewables in contrast to how energy related TO CO2 emissions have been increasing over the last three decades
## Project Overview



## Running the program
You can input 'Energy Data.py' on your terminal to run this program. I use Anaconda's command prompt on a Windows 10 machine.

## Program Details



## Requirements
*Language: Python 3.6 or above 
*Libraries: pandas, numpy, time

## Project Data
Energy Data.xlsx - this file is the dataset containing alltrend in energy consumption: i.e. fossil fuels and renewables in contrast to how energy related TO CO2 emissions as provided by Kaggle.

## Built with
* Python 3.6.6 - The language used to develop this. 
* pandas - One of the libraries used for this. 
* numpy - One of the libraries used for this

# Author
@UmehBEE - Sole author for this program. Mentioned all the help received in 'Acknowledgements' section.

## Acknowledgements
* pandas docs - pandas documentation was immensely helpful in understanding the implemention of pandas methods used in this project. 
* Kaggle - Data and their documented learning were extremely helpful while I was pursuing this project.
